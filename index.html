            <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in
                 which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
                 This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and the African diaspora. During the 18th to 19th centuries, 
                 enslaved people in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were referred to as Coromantees. Many 
                 of the leaders of enslaved people's rebellions had "day names" including Cuffy, Cuffee or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, Quao 
                 or Quaw, and Quamina or Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
           
            <p>Most Ghanaians have at least one name from this system, even if they also have an English or Christian name. Notable 
                figures with day names include Ghana's first president Kwame Nkrumah and former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</p>
