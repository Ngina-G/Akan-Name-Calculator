## Description
The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. This app correlates the exact day and date the user was born with the Akan name factoring in their gender. 

Upon opening the page, the user is greeted with a brief introduction to the Akan culture and naming system on the <strong>Landing page</strong>.

Then the user scrolls down and enters their details.
Once the user has submitted their info, a prompt appears with a personalized message and their Akan name.
